Yanran Wang is a second year Ph.D. student at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), where he is co-supervised by [Dr. David Boyle](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/david.boyle) and [Prof. Robert Shorten](https://robertshorten.com/). Currently, he is working in [Systems and Algorithms Laboratory (SysAL)](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/systems-algorithms-design-lab/) led by [Dr. Hamed Haddadi](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/h.haddadi). Prior to joining Imperial College, he received a M.S. degree in Information and Control at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/), Shanghai, China, in 2020, and a B.S. degree in Automation at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/), Nanjing, China, in 2017.

His research interests mainly include **Autonomous Navigation** and **(Safe) Reinforcement Learning** in Cyber-physical Systems. Particularly, he is interested in the theories and algorithms that empower quadrotors to see and think more intelligent. In addition to scientific research, he loves classic music and sports!

Please feel free to contact should you be interested in his research.
