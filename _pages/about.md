I'm Wenjie Lin (林文杰). I am currently a second-year MS student at Columbia Mechanical Engineering (Robotics and Control) and will be finishing a MS degree this December. Also, I am considering applying to a PhD program in Robotics or related areas. I am interested in data driven approaches that enable robots to make intelligent decisions in the real world. I hope to use my knowledge and passion to tackle the most important challenges in the world and free humanities with breakthrough technologies.

Before joining Columbia, I obtained my bachelor’s degree in Safety Engineering at University of Science and Technology Beijing (USTB) and used to study in UC Berkeley and UCLA for two semesters as an exchange student in Mechanical Engineering. 

In addition, I am a big fan of wake surfing, tennis, basketball, reading, guitar and singing!

Please feel free to contact should you be interested in his research.
